## INTRODUCTION
  * Privacy: after casting a vote, no one should be able to link the voter to this vote;
* Authenticity: only eligible voters can cast their votes;
* Integrity/accuracy: once a voter cast a vote, no alternation to this vote is permitted. Moreover, all valid votes must be counted, whereas all invalid votes must not be counted;
* Security: throughout the voting process, a vote canâ€™t be tampered with;
* Democracy: all eligible voters must be able to vote, one person - one vote and no one can vote more than once or vote for others.

* The system-specific requirements, on the other hand, are those requirements that are specific to the electronic-voting systems. The system-specific requirements include:
  * Multi-user: a number of voters can vote simultaneously;
  * Multi-campaign: a number of elections can be running simultaneously;
  * Accessibility: the system can be accessed by voters from any location using secure Internet and/or mobile devices;
  * Availability: the system must have high-availability during an election campaign.
