• Privacy: after casting a vote, no one should be able to link the voter to this vote;
• Authenticity: only eligible voters can cast their votes;
• Integrity/accuracy: once a voter cast a vote, no alternation to this vote is permitted. Moreover, all
valid votes must be counted, whereas all invalid votes must not be counted;
• Security: throughout the voting process, a vote can’t be tampered with;
• Democracy: all eligible voters must be able to vote, one person - one vote and no one can vote more
than once or vote for others.
The system-specific requirements, on the other hand, are those requirements that are specific to the
electronic-voting systems. The system-specific requirements include:
• Multi-user: a number of voters can vote simultaneously;
• Multi-campaign: a number of elections can be running simultaneously;
• Accessibility: the system can be accessed by voters from any location using secure Internet and/or
mobile devices;
• Availability: the system must have high-availability during an election campaign.
